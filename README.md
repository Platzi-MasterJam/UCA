# UCA - Air Pollution Consultant

## UCA app

<p>
Nowdays the pollution around big cities is relative high depending the day of the week. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that air pollution in the environment causes the death of 7 million people a year, due to heart attacks, heart disease, lung cancer and chronic respiratory diseases. About 91% of the world's population lives in places where air quality levels exceed the limits set by the WHO. What Causes Poor Air Quality? In urban areas, it is generally associated with an excessive and / or old automobile fleet, commercial activities, and depending on the case of the city, industrial activities in the vicinity. In rural areas, depending on the location of the cities or towns, it is mainly associated with nearby intensive industrial activities.

<p>
In the near future, people will review the air quality in their city to make important decisions about where to live, where to walk, where to travel, even where to work. To give that accessibility to the citizen, it is necessary to have a wide air quality monitoring network.

UCA app has the pollution in real time about how the pollution is in the city that you want visit, that city where you want to live, even if you have a chronic disease you can check which city is the best to move on, due to get a better quality life
